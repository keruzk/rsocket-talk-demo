# This is RSocket - future Reactive Protocol Demo Project

In this project there are a few modules 

* [Demo 1: Plain RSocket-Java](./demo-1-rsocket-java/README.MD) - Example of straightforward RSocket-Java server
* [Demo 2: RSocket Polyglot](./demo-2-rsocket-polyglot/README.MD) - Example of RSocket-Java Proxy server that connects to RSocket-JS
* [Demo 3: RSocket-RPC](./demo-3-from-grpc-to-rsocket-rpc/README.MD) - Example of miss-backpressure in GRPC and how we can easily move to RSocket-RPC to achieve backpressure supported RPC communication using the same Protocol-Buffer
